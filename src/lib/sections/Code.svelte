			Open source web tools
		</h2>
		<p>
			We've created the open source JavaScript library Embed to easily embed C2PA-compliant images in a UI that exposes the image's provenance to its viewer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Need assistance? We'll answer and questions you have, show you a demo, and help get Embed up and running on your website.
		</p>
		<h3>
