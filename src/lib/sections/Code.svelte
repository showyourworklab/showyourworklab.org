			Build trust with your audience by displaying C2PA-compliant images within an interactive frame that exposes verifiable data about how an image was made.
		</p>
		<p>
			Weâ€™re creating a tool that lets you augment your site's images with optional C2PA provenance data. The tool wraps your images within a frame allowing users to explore multiple layers of verifiable data about how an image is made, including whether it was captured with a camera or generated with AI.
		</p>
		<p>
			The tool is being developed to easily integrate into your newsroom or orgaization's workflow. We're developing the tool for <code>React</code>, <code>Svelte</code>, and as a <code>WordPress</code> block.
