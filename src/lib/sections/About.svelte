			What we do
		</h2>
		<p>
			We promote and produce trust-based image making for journalism and human rights.
		</p>
		<p>
			In a media landscape where the images we see online are becoming increasingly harder to trust and understand, our intiative promotes methods of building trust between journalists and organizations with the public.
		</p>
		<p>
			We support efforts to TKTK, including the technical standards developed by the <a href="https://c2pa.org/" target="_blank">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticty (C2PA)</a> for "certifying the source and history (or provenance) of media content."
