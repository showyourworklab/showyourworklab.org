					Human Rights
				</h3>
				<p>
					Advocacy organizations, NGOs, and lawyers often rely on photographs as evidence of violations and abuses to be shared with the wider public and in the courts to hold perpetrators accountable. However, the growing distrust in photography threatens its effectiveness. To address this, we plan to collaborate with these groups on projects that verify the authenticity of their images.
