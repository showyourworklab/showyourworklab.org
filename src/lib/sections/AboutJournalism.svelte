					We collaborate with newsrooms, engaging with both technical and editorial teams, in the entire storytelling process, from pitching stories and going on assignments with C2PA-compliant cameras to publication. We also assist in integrating our tool into a websiteâ€™s frontend and CMS and onboarding staff to the workflow.
